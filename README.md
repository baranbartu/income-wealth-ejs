    # JUST INFO THAT ALREADY DONE
    # Used NVM to manage npm/node packages (npm:5.4.2, node:8.8.1)
    # Used express-generator to generate directory: express --view=ejs app (we don't need to specify template engine since this will be just REST api) && cd app && mv * ../
    # ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD BE RUN
    # npm install
    # initialize database and dump data: run 'gulp'
    # gulp note: after finishing tasks, interrupt the hanged process by ctrl+c (i don't know why hanging)
    # DEBUG=app:* npm start
    # visit localhost:3000 and see what endpoints exists (HATEOAS)
